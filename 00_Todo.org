* The Adapters neede could be 3D-Printed (pretty much by anyone with a "normal" 3D-printerd
*
* The sensors support simple interfaces I²C and could be connected to a Micro controller, which is than connected to a piezo buzzer or "normal" led
* 
* I Could provide some basic arduino code, as there are a lot of people who can work with arduino and its a broadly available µC in all parts of the world
